Algorith for prime/composite
1. Start
2. Accept a number (>2)
3.Initailize counter with value 2
4. divide number with counter
5. If remainder is 0, display 'n' is composite and stop algorithm.
6. else increment counter and repeat step 4 until counter value is less than 'n'
7. After completion of all steps display number n is prime
8. Stop
